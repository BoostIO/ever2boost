# Something went wrong?
Unfortunately, ever2boost is not a perfect tool. Therefore it may contain some bugs. However I am convinced that it will not break your notes/folders.

# Folders/notes disappear
When your folders/notes disappear after import, you need to run `rm -rf ~/evernote_storage` and reload Boostnote. After that perhaps your Boostnote come back life. If your Boostnote is stil dead, please report an issue.
